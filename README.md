# Open Source Sentence Embedding Models as Feature Extractors in GNNs

This repository contains modules for running experiments using language models as encoders for various GNNs. As a first step, we have defined the directory structure, implemented the GCN, defined a LM encoder class, and created a dataloader for text/BoW for the Amazon products dataset. The modular directory structure will allow us to easily add new functionality and programmaticaly run our experiments.
